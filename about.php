        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Project GVM was created to take the guesswork out of 4WD weight management. After seeing too many overloaded vehicles on Australian tracks, we built a tool that uses real vehicle geometry rather than rough estimates.</p>
        
        <h3>Why We Built This</h3>
        <p>Understanding GVM, GCM, and Axle loads can be confusing. Our goal is to provide a free, easy-to-use tool that helps you visualize how your accessories—like bullbars, winches, and fridges—actually affect your vehicle's balance.</p>
