                    Hitching 3 tonnes of caravan or camper trailer to your vehicle changes everything. It changes how you steer, how you stop, and how you react in an emergency.

                    While our calculator helps you get the weights legal, staying safe on the road requires a different set of skills. Whether you’re towing a box trailer to the tip or a 24ft caravan around Australia, these principles will keep your rig upright and your family safe.

                <h3>1. The 10% Rule (Ball Weight Balance)</h3>
                <p>The single biggest cause of trailer instability is poor weight distribution.</p>

                <p>If you load too much weight at the back of the trailer (behind the trailer axles), the trailer acts like a pendulum. As speed increases, the trailer will begin to sway side-to-side, eventually overpowering the tow vehicle. This is often called "The Tail Wagging the Dog."</p>

                <p><strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> You generally want 10% of the loaded trailer's weight resting on the tow ball.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Too Heavy (15%+):</strong> You lift the front wheels of your car, losing steering and braking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Too Light (&lt;5%):</strong> The trailer becomes unstable and prone to violent sway.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Pack your heavy items (water tanks, batteries, tools) directly over or slightly in front of the trailer axles.</p>

                <h3>2. The "Pre-Flight" Walkaround</h3>
                <p>Treat your rig like an aircraft. Before you pull out of the driveway or leave a campsite, do a physical walkaround. Do not rely on memory.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hitch Locked?</strong> Visually check the coupling is locked onto the ball.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chains Crossed?</strong> Safety chains should be crossed under the hitch. If the trailer detaches, the crossed chains catch the drawbar, preventing it from digging into the tarmac and flipping the trailer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lights:</strong> Check indicators and brake lights (use a reflection in a window or ask a spotter).</li>
                    <li><strong>Handbrake:</strong> Ensure the trailer handbrake is fully released.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jockey Wheel:</strong> Double-check it is swung up and locked tight.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Speed vs. Stability</h3>
                <p>Just because the speed limit is 110km/h doesn't mean you should tow at 110km/h.</p>

                <p>Most trailer sway incidents occur at high speeds. The aerodynamic drag on a large caravan creates turbulence that can trigger instability.</p>

                <p><strong>The Sweet Spot:</strong> Many seasoned tourers stick to 90-100km/h. You save fuel, reduce mechanical stress, and you give yourself a buffer to react if things go wrong.</p>

                <h3>4. Handling Trailer Sway</h3>
                <p>If your trailer starts to sway (snake) behind you, your natural instinct will be to slam on the brakes. Do not do this. Braking hard while the trailer is swinging can cause it to jackknife.</p>

                <p><strong>What to do instead:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stay Calm:</strong> Do not make sudden steering inputs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ease off the accelerator:</strong> Let the vehicle slow down naturally.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use the Trailer Brakes:</strong> If you have an electric brake controller (like a Redarc), manually override it to apply only the trailer brakes. This pulls the trailer straight again, like pulling a piece of string taut.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Overtaking: The Patience Game</h3>
                <p>You are now a "Long Vehicle." Overtaking requires significantly more clear road than you think.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Momentum:</strong> You don't have the acceleration to zip around a road train.</li>
                    <li><strong>Suction:</strong> As you pass a large truck, the air pressure changes can pull your trailer toward the truck. Keep a wide berth and keep your hands firm on the wheel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Downhill:</strong> Never overtake downhill. Gravity is already pushing you; adding speed increases the risk of sway.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Tyres and Pressures</h3>
                <p>Your tyres are working harder than ever.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tow Vehicle:</strong> You are carrying a heavy load. You likely need to increase your rear tyre pressures (often 4-8 psi higher than unladen) to handle the weight and reduce sidewall flex.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trailer Tyres:</strong> They often sit idle for months. Check for cracking and ensure pressures are at the manufacturer's recommendation for the load.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Final Word</h3>
                <p>Towing is a responsibility. You are sharing the road with others while piloting a combination that can weigh over 6 or 7 tonnes.</p>

                <p>Take your time. Plan your braking early. If there is a huge queue of traffic behind you, pull over when safe and let them pass. The goal isn't to get there fast, it's to get there ready to enjoy the view.</p>
