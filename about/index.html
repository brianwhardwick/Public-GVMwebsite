                <h2>The History Behind The Calculator</h2>
                <p>Learn why accurately calculating axle loads is critical for your safety.</p>
                
                <h3>Born from a 200 Series Build</h3>
                <p>This calculator wasn’t built by a software company - it was built in a garage.</p>
                <p>It started when I was setting up my own <strong>Toyota LandCruiser 200 Series</strong> for touring. Like many 4WD owners, I had a long wish list: bullbar, winch, drawers, roof rack, dual batteries, and a fridge. But as I started adding up the numbers, I hit a wall.</p>

                <p>I realized that despite the LandCruiser's reputation, the factory payload is surprisingly low. As a Mechanical Engineer, I built a complex spreadsheet to track every kilogram, calculating moment arms and axle loads to figure out where I sat legally.</p>

                <h3>The Reality of Modern 4WDs</h3>
                <p>Manufacturers design these vehicles for stock standard conditions. They are not engineered by the factory to carry 400kg of steel protection, recovery gear, and camping equipment while towing a caravan.</p>

                <p>Most 4WDs will hit their <strong>Rear Axle Limit</strong> long before they hit their total GVM limit. This creates a dangerous "cantilever effect" where weight in the back lifts the front wheels, reducing steering traction and braking efficiency.</p>

                <h3>The "Engineer's Frustration"</h3>
                <p>We spend tens of thousands of dollars modifying our vehicles, yet figuring out if we are actually legal involves guessing or complex math. It became clear that staying legal isn't just about being careful - it’s actually mathematically difficult.</p>

                <p>A vehicle that is within its weight limits handles predictably, provides better comfort, and maintains off-road capability. The free calculator is designed to help you plan your build <em>before</em> you spend the money.</p>
