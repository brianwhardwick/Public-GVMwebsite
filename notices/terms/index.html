                <h3>Plain-English Summary (Non-Binding)</h3>
                <p>This overview is provided for convenience only and does not replace the full Terms of Use below. The following Terms and Conditions create a legally binding agreement between you and this website. While the full text below covers all legal specifics, the core principles of using this tool are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Estimation Only: This calculator uses theoretical mathematics and generic component weights. It is a planning tool, not a calibrated instrument.</li>
                    <li>Not a Weighbridge: The only way to confirm your vehicle is legal is to weigh it at a certified public weighbridge. You cannot rely solely on this website for legal compliance or insurance validation.</li>
                    <li>Your Responsibility: By using this site, you acknowledge that you are responsible for the safety, loading, and legal compliance of your own vehicle. Project GVM is not liable for fines, accidents, or insurance claims resulting from the use of this data.</li>
                <p>By accessing or using this website, you agree to be bound by the Terms outlined below.</p>
                </ul>

                <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
                <p>Last Updated: 24/12/2025 08:32</p>
                <p>TWelcome to Project GVM (the "Site"). By accessing or using our website and the GVM calculator tools contained within, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions (the "Terms"). Please review them carefully.</p>
                <p>If you do not agree to these Terms, you should not access or use this Site.</p>
  
                
                <h3>1. Nature of the Tool (The "Estimator" Clause)</h3>
                               
                <p>The GVM Calculator provided on this Site is designed for educational and illustrative purposes only. It is a theoretical estimation tool based on mathematical formulas and generic weight data.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Not a Substitute for Weighing: The results generated by this calculator are estimates and must not be treated as accurate measurements of your vehicle's actual weight. The only way to obtain an accurate vehicle weight is to use a certified public weighbridge.</li>
                    <li>Not Professional Advice: This Site does not provide engineering, legal, or professional safety advice. Using this tool does not create a professional relationship between you and Project GVM.</li>
                    <li>Dynamic Loading: The calculator does not account for dynamic loads, off-road conditions, braking forces, or real-world weight transfer.</li>
                </ul>
                 

                <h3>2. Accuracy of Data</h3>
                               
                <p>While we strive to keep the database of vehicle weights, accessory weights, and GVM upgrade specifications up to date, we make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, or suitability of the data.</p>   
                <ul>
                    <li>Variability: Manufacturer specifications can change without notice. The weight of modifications (e.g., bullbars, canopies, winches) varies significantly between brands and materials.</li>
                    <li>User Inputs: We are not responsible for errors in calculation resulting from incorrect data entered by you (the user).</li>
                    <li>Load Distribution: Calculations regarding axle loading and component positioning are theoretical approximations. Real-world physics, suspension sag, and dynamic loads may differ from the calculated results.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Any results depend on the assumptions selected by the user and may differ significantly from real-world outcomes.</p> 


                <h3>3. User Responsibilities</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Verification: You are solely responsible for verifying your vehicle’s actual weight at a certified weighbridge before traveling.</li>
                    <li>Compliance: You are responsible for ensuring your vehicle complies with all relevant laws, regulations, and manufacturer limitations regarding GVM, GCM (Gross Combination Mass), and axle limits in your jurisdiction.</li>
                    <li>Safety: You assume full responsibility for the safe loading and operation of your vehicle.</li>
                    <li>Jurisdiction: Vehicle compliance requirements vary between Australian states and territories.</li>
                </ul>
